# hamiltonian-path-finder-algorithm

This project explores the use of backtracking to solve the Hamiltonian Path problem, implemented in Python. The algorithm systematically searches for a path that visits each vertex in a graph exactly once, without forming a cycle. By recursively exploring all possible routes and backtracking when a dead-end is reached, the solution demonstrates how computationally intensive this problem can be, especially for larger graphs. This implementation was created as part of a coursework assignment in the Foundations of Algorithm Design and Analysis discipline at PUC Minas, focusing on understanding NP-complete problems and applying classic algorithmic strategies.

## üß© Understanding the Logic Behind the Hamiltonian Path Algorithm
The Hamiltonian Path algorithm using backtracking works by trying to construct a path that visits each vertex in a graph exactly once. Starting from an initial vertex, the algorithm recursively explores all unvisited neighbors, marking each visited vertex along the way. If it reaches a point where no unvisited adjacent vertices are available and the path is incomplete, it backtracks to the previous step and tries a different route. This process continues until a valid path covering all vertices is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

## Asymptotic Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
* Worst-case (O(N!)): In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible permutations of the vertices. For a graph with N vertices, there are N! possible ways to arrange these vertices in a path. Thus, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm must check every permutation, leading to a time complexity of O(N!).
* __Best-case (O(N)):__ In the best case, the algorithm may find the Hamiltonian path early, such as on the first few branches of the search tree. If a valid path is found quickly, the algorithm performs in a nearly linear fashion, giving a time complexity of O(N).
* __Average-case (Exponential Growth):__ The average-case complexity depends on the structure and density of the graph. In a dense graph, where many vertices are connected, the search tree grows rapidly, and the algorithm may explore many possible paths before finding a solution. This results in exponential time complexity, often approximated as O(2^N), where N is the number of vertices.



### Conclusion
The overall complexity is dominated by the factorial growth in the worst case, which makes the algorithm inefficient for large graphs. The actual performance can vary depending on the graph's structure, but in general, the Hamiltonian Path problem is NP-complete and has high computational demands as the number of vertices increases.
